# #helpwanted

This repository is naught but a place to store [#helpwanted](https://github.com/codeforamerica/helpwanted/labels/help%20wanted) requests. These requests are cries for help from real civic hackers in the wild. They are opportunites for you to use your skills to help out on real civic issues in your city.

Making a request for help here and it will show up all over the place. Code for America promotes these widely through http://www.codeforamerica.org/geeks/civicissues and other tools.
